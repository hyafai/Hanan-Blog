We hypothesised that if there is more tasty and unhealthy food in one than another context, people will perceive an unhealthy-tasty relationship, regardless of the actual contingency between health and taste. Conversely, if there is more tasty and healthy food in one than another context, people will perceive a healthy-tasty relationship.\n\n### [Procedure:]{.underline}\n\nParticipants viewed graphs summarising health and taste ratings (i.e., base rates) from two different food contexts, specifically delivery apps. Afterwards, they indicated to what extent they perceived a relationship between health and taste, separately in each context, as well as overall, across contexts.\n\n### [Design:]{.underline}\n\n4 conditions in a mixed design. Each participant viewed information about food from two contexts (within factor `context`) Participants were randomly assigned to the `harmonious` or `conflicting` base rate manipulation (between factor `condition`). In the `harmonious` base rate manipulation group, there were both more healthy and tasty foods in the first than the second context. In the `conflicting` base rate manipulation group, there were more unhealthy and tasty foods in the first than the second context.\n\nThe contexts had different names which were counter-balanced between participants (variable `random_app`).\n\n### [Dependent measures:]{.underline}\n\nThe dependent variable was participants' perceived relationship between healthiness and tastiness, which we assessed in two ways:\n\nParticipants indicated for each context how likely they would get a tasty food when getting a healthy and an unhealthy food on two slider scales from 0% to 100% (Conditional probability estimate).\n\nThey also indicated, within each context as well as across contexts, whether the healthy or the unhealthy foods were tastier, on a slider scale from 1 = *the unhealthy meals* to 100 = *the healthy meals* (Relative contingency belief).\n\nIn addition, participants indicated what kind of food they would more likely order from any of the contexts, on a Likert scale ranging from 1 = *an unhealthy food* to 11 = *a healthy food* (Preference).\n\n### [Manipulation checks and additional measures:]{.underline}\n\nTo ensure that participants recognized the different frequencies of healthy and tasty food across the different contexts, they estimated how many foods per context were (un)healthy and (not) tasty, respectively (Base rate estimates).\n\nThe manipulation check analyses are documented in a separate R markdown file: `Study1_manipulation_checks.Rmd`.\n\nAdditionally, we administered the protestant ethic scale (PES) to control for its possible influence in the analyses. For the control analyses, see the separate R markdown file `Study1_control.Rmd`.\n\nWe also asked participants how often they ordered food via delivery apps or websites, with answer options \"Never\", \"Rarely\", \"Sometimes\", and \"Often\". If they chose any answer other than \"Never\", we asked them to rate the tastiness and healthiness of the food offered by the delivery apps they used in their daily life. Descriptive analyses of these variables can be found in the separate R markdown file `Study1_control.Rmd`.\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n\n\n# Perceived health-taste relationship within contexts\n\n## [DV 1: Conditional probability estimate:]{.underline}\n\nFirst, we tested the effects of base rate manipulation, context and their interaction on participants' conditional probability estimate. We calculated a mixed ANOVA, testing the effect of the between-subjects factor base rate manipulation (harmonious vs. conflicting), within-subjects factor context (1st vs. 2nd) and their interaction on the conditional probability estimate. We expected a significant main effect of base rate manipulation.\n\n\n\n\n\n### Descriptive statistics\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\nTable: Mean perceived health-taste relationship by base rate manipulation and context\n\n|Base rate manipulation |Context     |  N| Mean contingency estimate| Std.
