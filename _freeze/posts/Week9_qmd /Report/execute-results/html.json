(2019). In total there are 497577 reviews in the dataset.\n\n## [Number of Reviews by Year:]{.underline}\n\nThe below histogram shows the number of video game reviews submitted to Amazon by year. From 1999 reviews largely increased year-on-year which is unsurprising given the growth of Amazon and access to the internet. The dataset shows the peak number of reviews was 2015 with a decline from 2016 to 2018. It is likely that this reflects the dataset being incomplete for recent years rather than the number of reviews declining in reality. Number of reviews per year:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](Report_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-2-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## [Verified Users:]{.underline}\n\nThe dataset contains details of whether the review was based on a verified purchase.[From Amazon Community:](https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=G75XTB7MBMBTXP6W)\n\n> An \"Amazon Verified Purchase\" review means that we've verified that the person writing the review purchased the product from Amazon, and didn't receive the product at a big discount. Reviews that are not marked \"Amazon Verified Purchase\" are valuable as well, but, either we cannot confirm that the product was purchased from Amazon, or that the customer paid a price that is available to most Amazon shoppers. \n\nTable 1 shows the number of reviews based on verified and unverified purchases.\n\n\n::: {#tbl-verified .cell tbl-cap='Number of reviews by purchase status'}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n|verified | counts|\n|:--------|------:|\n|FALSE    | 164932|\n|TRUE     | 332645|\n:::\n:::\n\n\nWhilst the number of verified reviews is substantially larger than the number of unverified reviews, the below histogram demonstrates that this has not been a consistent trend and that the large increase in the number of reviews is largely driven by an increase in verified reviews.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n```\n`summarise()` has grouped output by 'year'.
