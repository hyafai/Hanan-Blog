Only do this from the console pane or the packages tab of the lower right pane.\n\n    -   to load a package this is done using the `library()` function\n\n-   You can type `?function_name` in the console to access the help file.\n\n-   **Tab auto-complete**\n\n    If you write the name of the function and then press the tab key, R Studio will show you the arguments that function takes along with a brief description\n\n-   **Arguments** : sample(x, size, replace = FALSE, prob = NULL)\n\n `x` is the list of items we want to choose from, `size` is the number of items we want to choose, `replace` is whether or not each item may be selected more than once, and `prob` gives the probability that each item is chosen. it will use defaults of `FALSE` (each item can only be chosen once) and `NULL` (all items will have equal probability of being chosen).\n\n**Example:**\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nsample(size = 5, replace = TRUE, x = letters)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[1] \"u\" \"l\" \"z\" \"m\" \"i\"\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n-   **Objects** can contain numbers, words, or the result of operations and analyses.\n\n    -   You assign content to an object using `<-`\n\n\n    ```{=html}\n    <!-- -->\n    ```\n\n    -   For (text) data In order for R to recognize it as text, it **must** be enclosed in double quotation marks `\" \"` You cant do this for numeric data.\n\n    -   To print the contents of an object, type the object's name in the console and press enter.\n\n-   **How to commit and push changes to github:**\n\n    -   Make changes to your blog, like writing a new post, or editing an old one.\n\n    -    Render the website in R-studio. What you see here should be what you will see later on Github.com\n\n    -   Open Github Desktop and **Commit your changes**, by writing brief commit title, and pressing commit.\n\n    -    Then, use Github Desktop to **Push your changes** to github.com.\n\n    -    Wait half a minute or so, and you should see your new content appear on the website.\n\n\n```{=html}\n<!-- -->\n```\n\n-   Always add line between your commands\n\n-   To quickly make the r code block click at the same time:\n\n    **(options+ command + I).**\n",
