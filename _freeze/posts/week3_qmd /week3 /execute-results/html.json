Explain how the rendering environment is different from the Rstudio environment.\n\n    -   The rendering environment runs (execute) the code and embeds results and text into an (Rmd) document. The Rstudio Environment is a collection of objects such as functions, variables, data and so on that is present in the current R session.\n\n12. Be aware of more advanced quarto options for html documents, and try some of the options.\n\n    -   ( done by exploring and changing the blog theme using qurto options for html doc)\n",
