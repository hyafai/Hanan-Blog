Only do this from the console pane or the packages tab of the lower right pane.\nto load a package this is done using the library() function\n\nYou can type ?function_name in the console to access the help file.\nTab auto-complete\nIf you write the name of the function and then press the tab key, R Studio will show you the arguments that function takes along with a brief description\nArguments : sample(x, size, replace = FALSE, prob = NULL)\n\n x is the list of items we want to choose from, size is the number of items we want to choose, replace is whether or not each item may be selected more than once, and prob gives the probability that each item is chosen. it will use defaults of FALSE (each item can only be chosen once) and NULL (all items will have equal probability of being chosen).\nExample:\n\nsample(size = 5, replace = TRUE, x = letters)\n\n[1] \"c\" \"s\" \"d\" \"w\" \"i\"\n\n\n\nObjects can contain numbers, words, or the result of operations and analyses.\n\nYou assign content to an object using <-\n\n\n\nFor (text) data In order for R to recognize it as text, it must be enclosed in double quotation marks \" \" You cant do this for numeric data.\nTo print the contents of an object, type the object’s name in the console and press enter.\n\nHow to commit and push changes to github:\n\nMake changes to your blog, like writing a new post, or editing an old one.\nRender the website in R-studio. What you see here should be what you will see later on Github.com\nOpen Github Desktop and Commit your changes, by writing brief commit title, and pressing commit.\nThen, use Github Desktop to Push your changes to github.com.\nWait half a minute or so, and you should see your new content appear on the website.\n\n\n\n\nAlways add line between your commands\nTo quickly make the r code block click at the same time:\n(options+ command + I)."
