-   **To customize how R Studio looks in a way that works for you Click:**

    -   Tools \> Global Options \> Appearance

-   **To install packages this is done using** `install.packages()`

    -   Important : Never install a package from inside a script. Only do this from the console pane or the packages tab of the lower right pane.

    -   to load a package this is done using the `library()` function

-   You can type `?function_name` in the console to access the help file.

-   **Tab auto-complete**

    If you write the name of the function and then press the tab key, R Studio will show you the arguments that function takes along with a brief description

-   **Arguments** : sample(x, size, replace = FALSE, prob = NULL)

 `x` is the list of items we want to choose from, `size` is the number of items we want to choose, `replace` is whether or not each item may be selected more than once, and `prob` gives the probability that each item is chosen. it will use defaults of `FALSE` (each item can only be chosen once) and `NULL` (all items will have equal probability of being chosen).

**Example:**

```{r}
sample(size = 5, replace = TRUE, x = letters)
```

-   **Objects** can contain numbers, words, or the result of operations and analyses.

    -   You assign content to an object using `<-`

    <!-- -->

    -   For (text) data In order for R to recognize it as text, it **must** be enclosed in double quotation marks `" "` You cant do this for numeric data.

    -   To print the contents of an object, type the object's name in the console and press enter.

-   **How to commit and push changes to github:**

    -   Make changes to your blog, like writing a new post, or editing an old one.

    -   Render the website in R-studio. What you see here should be what you will see later on Github.com

    -   Open Github Desktop and **Commit your changes**, by writing brief commit title, and pressing commit.

    -   Then, use Github Desktop to **Push your changes** to github.com.

    -   Wait half a minute or so, and you should see your new content appear on the website.

Always add line between your commands

-   To quickly make the r code block click at the same time:

    **(options+ command + I).**
